# GRADUAL MIGRATION MODE
# =============================================================================
# This file was generated with --ignore-all for gradual migration.
# All existing directories are listed below.
#
# Migration workflow:
# 1. Start with everything ignored (current state)
# 2. Pick a foundational package (one with no internal dependencies)
# 3. Remove it from this file
# 4. Run: bazel run //:gazelle
# 5. Fix any build issues
# 6. Verify: bazel build //<package>/...
# 7. Repeat with packages that depend on already-migrated packages
#
# See MIGRATION.md for detailed guidance.
